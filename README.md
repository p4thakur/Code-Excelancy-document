Pipeline Stages:
1. Source Control → 2. Build → 3. Test → 4. Security Scan → 
5. Package → 6. Deploy to Staging → 7. Integration Tests → 
8. Deploy to Production → 9. Health Check → 10. Rollback Ready
```

#### 8.1.2 Mandatory Pipeline Gates
- **Build Gate**: Code must compile without warnings
- **Test Gate**: All tests must pass with minimum coverage requirements
- **Security Gate**: No high/critical vulnerabilities allowed
- **Quality Gate**: SonarQube quality gate must pass
- **Approval Gate**: Manual approval required for production deployments

### 8.2 Environment Standards

#### 8.2.1 Environment Consistency
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All environments defined using Terraform, CloudFormation, or equivalent
- **Environment Parity**: Development, staging, and production must be functionally identical
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configs managed via external systems (not code)
- **Resource Isolation**: Each environment must have isolated resources (databases, queues, etc.)

#### 8.2.2 Environment Requirements
```yaml
Development:
  - Lightweight versions of production services
  - Shared resources acceptable
  - Auto-deployment from feature branches
  - Relaxed security policies for debugging

Staging:
  - Production-like environment
  - Full security policies enforced
  - Production data volume (anonymized)
  - Manual deployment approval required

Production:
  - High availability configuration
  - Full monitoring and alerting
  - Encrypted data at rest and in transit
  - Zero-downtime deployment capability
```

### 8.3 Deployment Strategies

#### 8.3.1 Deployment Patterns
**Blue-Green Deployment** (Recommended for web applications)
- Maintain two identical production environments
- Switch traffic between environments for zero-downtime deployments
- Instant rollback capability
- Higher infrastructure cost but maximum safety

**Rolling Deployment** (For stateful applications)
- Gradual replacement of instances
- Maintains service availability during deployment
- Slower rollback process
- Lower resource requirements

**Canary Deployment** (For high-risk changes)
- Deploy to small subset of users/servers first
- Monitor metrics and gradually increase traffic
- Automated rollback on anomaly detection
- Required for major feature releases

#### 8.3.2 Deployment Decision Matrix
| Application Type | Primary Strategy | Fallback Strategy | Use Cases |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Stateless Web Apps | Blue-Green | Rolling | Most web applications |
| Microservices | Rolling | Canary | API services |

## 9. Monitoring Standards

### 9.1 Monitoring Philosophy and Principles

#### 9.1.1 Core Principles
- **Observability over Monitoring**: Focus on understanding system behavior, not just collecting metrics
- **Three Pillars**: Metrics, Logs, and Traces form the foundation of observability
- **Proactive Detection**: Identify issues before they impact users
- **Signal vs Noise**: Alert on actionable items only to prevent alert fatigue
- **Business Impact Focus**: Monitor what matters to business outcomes

#### 9.1.2 Monitoring Strategy
```
Monitoring Pyramid:
┌─────────────────┐
│   User Impact   │  ← Business metrics, SLA adherence
├─────────────────┤
│  Service Health │  ← Application metrics, error rates
├─────────────────┤
│ Infrastructure  │  ← System metrics, resource utilization
└─────────────────┘
```

### 9.2 Metrics Standards

#### 9.2.1 Golden Signals (RED/USE Method)
**RED Method for Services:**
- **Rate**: Requests per second
- **Errors**: Error rate and types
- **Duration**: Response time distribution

**USE Method for Resources:**
- **Utilization**: Percentage of resource capacity used
- **Saturation**: Degree of resource overload
- **Errors**: Error count and types

#### 9.2.2 Required Application Metrics
```yaml
# Standard application metrics
http_requests_total:
  type: counter
  labels: [method, endpoint, status_code, service]
  description: "Total HTTP requests"

http_request_duration_seconds:
  type: histogram
  labels: [method, endpoint, service]
  buckets: [0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10]
  description: "HTTP request duration"

database_queries_total:
  type: counter
  labels: [query_type, table, result]
  description: "Database queries executed"

active_connections:
  type: gauge
  labels: [connection_type, service]
  description: "Active connections count"

business_events_total:
  type: counter
  labels: [event_type, user_type, outcome]
  description: "Business-relevant events"
```

#### 9.2.3 Infrastructure Metrics
**Server/Container Metrics:**
- CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O
- Network throughput and error rates
- Container restart counts and reasons

**Database Metrics:**
- Query execution time, connection pool usage

- Consumer lag and throughput

### 9.3 Alerting Standards

#### 9.3.1 Alert Severity Levels
```yaml
CRITICAL (P1):
  description: "Service completely unavailable or data loss risk"
  response_time: "5 minutes"
  escalation: "Immediate page to on-call engineer"
  examples:
    - Service returning 50x errors for >2 minutes
    - Database primary unavailable
    - Security breach detected

HIGH (P2):
  description: "Significant service degradation"
  response_time: "15 minutes"
  escalation: "Alert to on-call engineer"
  examples:
    - Error rate >5% for >5 minutes
    - Response time >2x baseline for >10 minutes
    - Key dependency unavailable

MEDIUM (P3):
  description: "Service degradation that may impact users"
  response_time: "30 minutes during business hours"
  escalation: "Notify team via chat/email"
  examples:
    - Error rate >1% for >15 minutes
    - Resource utilization >80% for >30 minutes

LOW (P4):
  description: "Potential issues requiring attention"
  response_time: "Next business day"
  escalation: "Create ticket for investigation"
  examples:
    - Disk usage >75%
    - Certificate expiring in 30 days
```

#### 9.3.2 Alert Design Principles
- **Actionable**: Every alert must have a clear response action
- **Specific**: Alert should identify the problem and affected component
- **Contextual**: Include relevant metadata and links to dashboards
- **Escalating**: Alerts should escalate if not acknowledged
- **Self-Healing**: Alerts should auto-resolve when conditions clear

#### 9.3.3 Alert Templates
```yaml
# Standard alert template
alert: HighErrorRate
expr: (
  rate(http_requests_total{status_code=~"5.."}[5m]) /
  rate(http_requests_total[5m])
) > 0.05
for: 5m
labels:
  severity: high
  team: backend
  service: user-api
annotations:
  summary: "High error rate detected for {{ $labels.service }}"
  description: |
    Error rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} for service {{ $labels.service }}
    over the last 5 minutes. This exceeds the 5% threshold.

    dbSpan.setAttributes({
      'db.rows_affected': result.rowCount
    });
    dbSpan.end();

    span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.OK });
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    span.recordException(error);

      rate(http_requests_total[1h])
    )
  ) > (0.001 * 14.4)  # 14.4x burn rate (99.9% SLO)
for: 2m
labels:
  severity: high
  slo_type: availability
annotations:
  summary: "High error budget burn rate for {{ $labels.service }}"
  description: |
    The error budget for {{ $labels.service }} is being consumed

### 12.5 Resource Modeling and Sizing

#### 12.5.1 Application Resource Models
```yaml
Web Application Model:
  cpu_per_request: "Average CPU cycles per request"
  memory_per_session: "RAM required per user session"
  database_connections: "Connections needed per instance"
  formula: |
    required_instances = (
      peak_requests_per_second * cpu_per_request / cpu_per_instance +
      concurrent_sessions * memory_per_session / memory_per_instance
    ) * safety_factor

Database Model:
  storage_growth: "Data growth rate per month"
  connection_requirements: "Connections per application instance"
  query_load: "Queries per second capacity"
  formula: |
    storage_needed = current_storage * (1 + monthly_growth_rate)^months
    connection_pool_size = max_concurrent_connections * 1.2
    read_replicas = query_load / queries_per_replica_capacity

Message Queue Model:
  message_rate: "Messages per second"
  message_size: "Average message size in bytes"
  processing_time: "Time to process each message"
  formula: |
    queue_capacity = message_rate * processing_time * 1.5
    storage_needed = message_rate * message_size * retention_period
```

#### 12.5.2 Infrastructure Sizing Guidelines
```yaml
Compute Sizing:
  cpu_target_utilization: "70% during normal operations"
  memory_target_utilization: "75% during normal operations"
  safety_buffer: "25% additional capacity for spikes"
  
  sizing_rules:
    - "Never exceed 80% CPU utilization during normal load"
    - "Keep memory utilization below 85% to avoid swapping"
    - "Plan for 2x current peak load as baseline capacity"
    - "Add 20% buffer for unexpected growth"

Storage Sizing:
  disk_utilization_limit: "80% maximum utilization"

  3. Activate read replicas for databases
  4. Implement rate limiting for non-critical endpoints
  5. Scale up critical path services first

# Emergency scaling playbook
emergency_scaling_steps:
  step_1:
    action: "Scale web tier to maximum instances"
    time_limit: "2 minutes"
    rollback: "Reduce instances if cost threshold exceeded"
  
  step_2:
    action: "Enable aggressive caching policies"
    time_limit: "1 minute"
    rollback: "Disable cache if data consistency issues"
  
  step_3:
    action: "Activate database read replicas"
    time_limit: "5 minutes"
    rollback: "Route traffic back to primary if replica lag > 1s"
```
